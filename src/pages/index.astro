          title="The Count - Leopold von Heldenherz"
          description="Count Leopold von Heldenherz rose from a minor noble branch to rule Averburg following a devastating greenskin raid fifteen years ago. Forged in the frozen forests of Ostland as a mercenary captain of the 'Winter Wolves', he built his legend battling Chaos marauders and beastmen. His legendary golden warhammer 'Sonnenhammer' was blessed by a high priest of Sigmar after slaying a powerful Chaos champion at Frostwail Pass. At 57, this battle-scarred warrior continues training daily, often seen practicing in the courtyard with his gleaming weapon. His strategic marriage to Lady Mathilda von Teufelfeuer of Reikland brought valuable alliances. Under his leadership, Averburg has flourished both militarily and commercially—his former mercenary contacts proving invaluable for trade and intelligence as dark omens gather."

          title="The Son - Albrecht von Heldenherz"
          description="Albrecht von Heldenherz stands as both heir to Averburg and Chapter Master of the Knights of Sigmar's Blood, embodying the dual legacies of noble governance and martial devotion. Unlike his father who earned his fame as a mercenary, Albrecht was groomed from birth for leadership, trained by Averburg's finest knights and veteran commanders. His exceptional skill with blade and lance surpassed his tutors, earning him renown in tournaments across the region. At nineteen, he chose to join the Knights of Sigmar's Blood, rising with remarkable speed to Chapter Master. Now in his early thirties, he cuts an imposing figure in ornate armor adorned with the von Heldenherz crest. His sternly handsome features resemble his father's, though lacking Leopold's weathered scars. Disciplined and methodical, Albrecht wields the masterfully crafted sword Felbane, forged in Nuln and blessed in Sigmar's Cathedral."

          title="The Captain - Wilhelm Gauss"
          description="Wilhelm Gauss, Captain of the Steelwatch, was born into a family of soldiers in the borderlands of Averland. Enlisting in Averburg's garrison at a young age, he rose quickly through the ranks through unshakable resolve and battlefield cunning. Though lacking noble blood, his deeds have earned respect from both his men and the ruling house. A pragmatist guided by duty and the rule of law, Gauss has little patience for excuses, corruption, or cowardice. His loyalty to Count Leopold is unwavering—he considers himself both shield and sword of Averburg. Despite his stern exterior, those who have fought alongside him know he harbors a deep sense of duty to the common folk, seeing himself as protector of the innocent and scourge to criminals and bandits. His effectiveness in keeping Averburg safe is undeniable, even if some find his methods too rigid."

          title="The Priest - Volkmar Eisenbrand"
          description="Volkmar Eisenbrand, raised in the shadow of Nuln to a poor but devout family, was instilled with love for Sigmar and hatred for the Empire's enemies by his soldier father. When beastmen overran his village, a passing band of Sigmarite priests saved the young Volkmar, who swore his life to their cause by joining the Order of the Silver Hammer—a sect dedicated to rooting out corruption. His faith is unyielding, his oratory fiery enough to inspire demoralized men to charge into battle. Volkmar has no patience for bureaucracy, weakness, or indecision, believing only through strength, sacrifice, and devotion can the Empire endure. Unlike priests who prefer sermons to combat, Volkmar lets his warhammer and fiery prayers do the talking. On the battlefield, he is relentless, smiting foes with blessed fury while invoking Sigmar's might to strengthen allies."

          title="The Hunter - Otto Feuerschlag"
          description="Otto Feuerschlag's past lies shrouded in smoke and blood. Born to a humble blacksmith near Averland's border, his life shattered when witchfire consumed his village, leaving his face burned and his family reduced to cinders. From that day, he swore vengeance upon all who wield unnatural powers. Taken in by a traveling Witch Hunter, Otto was honed into a weapon of Sigmar's wrath. For decades, he has hunted heretics, burned cults, and purged corruption from the Empire's heartlands. A man of grim certainty, Otto believes mercy merely opens gateways to damnation. Pragmatic yet brutal, he sees hesitation as allowing darkness to spread. Feared even among allies, Otto perceives corruption everywhere—once his suspicion falls upon someone, it rarely lifts. His presence makes the guilty break into cold sweats, and few survive his interrogations. Despite his terrifying reputation, he sees himself not as a sadist but as a necessary evil who has sacrificed his soul so others may sleep soundly."

          title="The Engineer - Klaus Nehrig"
          description="Klaus Nehrig, born and trained in Nuln, the Empire's industrial heart, was once a promising engineer at the Imperial Gunnery School. Specializing in artillery design, black powder refinement, and mechanical fortifications, he served under Nuln's greatest engineering minds. His career derailed when an experimental cannon misfired during a demonstration, killing several noble patrons. Though proclaiming innocence, political forces ensured his quiet dismissal. Undeterred, Klaus became a gun-for-hire, offering his expertise to border fortresses and mercenary companies before arriving in Averburg. Count Leopold recognized his talent, appointing him engineer and steward tasked with modernizing the city's defenses. Brilliant but impatient, Klaus dismisses traditional warfare as 'a relic for fools who haven't embraced the future.' He respects discipline but clashes with religious zealots and conservative commanders who fear gunpowder's rise. His pragmatism sometimes borders on fault, viewing faith and superstition as dangerous hindrances to technological progress."

          title="The Wizard - Erhard Grimm"
          description="Erhard Grimm, native of Altdorf, was inducted into the Amethyst College after showing an innate connection to Shyish, the Wind of Death. As a student, his keen intellect and unnerving patience stood out, though even among fellow death magic practitioners, he was considered distant and unsettling. After completing his training, Erhard traveled across the Empire, serving noble houses, battlefield commanders, and occult scholars. Unlike many Amethyst Wizards who merely oversee the transition of souls, Erhard takes a more active approach, using his understanding of mortality, entropy, and fate to advise rulers on avoiding untimely demise. His service to Count Leopold is both practical and mysterious—while the Count values his foresight regarding dangers, Erhard's true motives remain unclear. He speaks in measured tones, never raising his voice, yet his words carry inevitable weight. Many in Averburg whisper he is more specter than man, fearing his presence invites death rather than prevents it. Despite his unnerving nature, Erhard is neither cruel nor sadistic—he simply perceives existence through Shyish's lens, where all things must wither, all lives must end, and all power must fade."
